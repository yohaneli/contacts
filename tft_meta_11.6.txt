	DEPENDING ON CHOSEN, IT WILL DETERMINE WHAT YOUR EARLY/MIDGAME BOARD WILL LOOK LIKE, WHICH WILL

	HELP GIVE YOU DIRECTION WHAT LATE GAME COMP TO PLAY AND NOT TO PLAY (ALONG W/ ITEMS)



	

		EXAMPLES:

			MAGE CHOSEN > WILL BE PLAYING ANNIE, LULU, VEIGAR, EASY PIVOT INTO MAGES, ASOL COMP, NO KAYLE, NO TALON, NO SLAYERS



4. ROLLING AT LEVEL 6, 7



	HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON CURRENT HP, STRENGTH OF BOARD VS LOBBY, ECON, CHOSEN, BENCH, ETC



	WHEN TO ROLL AT 6 (STAGE 3-2): 

		IF U HAVE MULTIPLE PAIRS, OR IF U ARE LOSING FIGHTS AND NEED A NEW CHOSEN, OR IF CURRENT CHOSEN HAS MINIMAL VALUE FOR BOARD

		STOP WHEN STABLE, USUALLY DONT GO BELOW 10, BUT IF NOT STABLE ROLL TO 0!!

		IF U LOST ALL OF STAGE 2, U 100% NEED TO ROLL AT LEVEL 6



	WHEN TO ROLL AT 7 (STAGE 4-1): 

		IF U HAVE MULTIPLE PAIRS

		IF YOU CAN'T GO FAST 8 AT STAGE 4-5, SHOULD ROLL DOWN AND GET A STRONG BOARD TO LAST ALL OF STAGE 4

		IF YOU WANT A NEW CHOSEN, SELL CHOSEN AND ROLL FOR BETTER BOARD ALONG W/ NEW CHOSEN (SOME CHOSENS ARE STRONG STAGE 2,3, BUT FALL OFF STAGE 4)

		IF LOW HP/PLAYING FOR TOP 6, JUST ROLL TO 0 TO STABILIZE

		IF TRANSITIONING/COMMITTING TO A LEVEL 7 COMP (KEEPERS, BRAWLERS, FABLED, SIVIR, etc)

	

		IF U HAVE HP TO TANK UNTIL 4-5, AND WILL HAVE ABOUT 40-50 GOLD TO ROLL AT STAGE 4-5 WHILE STAYING ABOVE 40HP, GO 8 AT 4-5, ITS OP



5. WHAT TO LOOK FOR AT LEVEL 6/7 ROLLDOWN



	LEVEL 6 - LOOK TO UPGRADE YOUR 1COST / 2COST UNITS, BUILD AROUND YOUR CHOSEN



	LEVEL 7 - LOOK TO UPGRADE YOUR 1/2/3 COST UNITS, DO NOT EXPECT TO 2 STAR A 4 COST CARRY



			EXAMPLE: 

				PLAYING KAYLE - LOOK TO UPGRADE JAX 2, IRELIA 2, KINDRED 2, YUUMI 2, PICK A CHOSEN GOOD W/BOARD, CAN HAVE TEEMO 2, KALISTA 2 HOLD KAYLE ITEMS

				PLAYING SLAYERS - LOOK TO UPGRADE 2 STAR BRAUM, 2 STAR PYKE, 2 STAR TEEMO, SIVIR/KALISTA ITEM HOLDER



				YOU CAN HAVE KAYLE 1/ OLAF 1/ TRYNDAMERE 1 JUST HOLD ITEMS, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT STRONGER



				YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR FULL SLAYER/KAYLE BOARD, ITS NOT POSSIBLE - DO NO EXPECT TO HIT SEJ 2, AATROX 2, SHEN 2, ETC.
